<h1>condmerge</h1>

This action does not do anything, but help to layout the graph to state that there is a 
split or join point.<p>

Visually it is the condition/merge of UML.<p>

Normally the graphic element is included and is from the branches that exit from this node 
where the conditions or guards are set. If the condition fits, that branch is executed.
