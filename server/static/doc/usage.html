<h1>Ussage of Behaviours</h1>

With behaviours user can create new complex behaviours.<p>

This beheviours are based on <b>events</h> and <b>actions</b>, creating chains that join them. It exists as well the 
posibility of completing behaviours with <a href="lua.html">LUA</a> programing language code.

<h2>Events</h2>

Events are spontaneus changes that appear on the system, for example some sensor detected something, or just time passes. 
<p>
The simplest event is the timeout, that just triggers every X seconds. Another easy event is the start event, that is
triggered when the behaviour starts.


<h2>Actions</h2>

Actions are the response to the evetns. They can mean sending some web petition, an email, show something on the screen... Other more
complex actions may need LUA code.

<h2>Strings</h2>

Events and actiosn are joined by strings. Once an event happens, the actions that is joined by an string is performed. To this action more
actions can follow, creating a complex behaviour based on a simple event.<p>

At strings there may be bifurcations, where several actions follow an event or another action. In such case user can set a guard, to 
force one path depending on simple conditions, or if several guards succeds, one is randomly selected. If there are no more actions 
following this path, the behaviour is completed, and the system waits for new events.

Path can also join to a simple event, so that the execution flow joins.
