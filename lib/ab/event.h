  /**
   * @short An Event is a node that checks for some condition and activates when it fulfills.
   *
   * Events are 'spontaneus' changes on the system that will be notified to whoever is listening.
   *
   * An example of an event is a timeout that after N seconds its activated.
   *
   * Events are connected to actions which will make some change on the system, like changing some
   * color or showing something.
   *
   * Events can be purely spontaneus which means that at some moment they will be notified to the
   * manager, or polling. Polling events have a function check called every little time to check
   * if the desired trigger condition meets.
   *
   * Spontaneus events are highly prefered, but they are not always possible. Spontaneus events may
   * have a processing thread that just AB::Manager::notify(...) the event.
   *
   * On some conditions its necesary to have event group managers that are the ones that really
   * do the processing. For example the touch events look for a specific place of touch but may be
   * several of them, each consuming the touch events. The solution is transparently create a touch
   * manager which do the polling and which triggers the other touch events when the conditions meet.
   * So on this example the touch_manager is a polling event and the other touch events are 'spontaneus'
   * events triggered by the manager. The manager is created, if does not exist, at AB::Node::setManager time.
